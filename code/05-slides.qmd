## Dataset

::: incremental
-   Washington Ocean Acidification Center Cruises
-   2018-2020
-   April, July, September
-   7 sites in Puget Sound
-   zooplankton samples from net tows
-   metabarcoding marker: mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI)
:::

## Project Goals

::: incremental
1.  Taxonomically ID zooplankton communities using sequence reads

2.  Compare zooplankton communities among

-   years
-   seasons
-   locations
:::

## Methods to-date

1.  Download data
2.  Trim primers using cutadapt (in progress)

## Trimming primers

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "8-9"
#set file path
path <- "../data"
#make matched list of forward and reverse reads
fnFs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = "_R1_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE))
fnRs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = "_R2_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE))

#specify primer sequences
FWD <- "GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC"  
REV <- "TAIACYTCIGGRTGICCRAARAAYCA "  
```

## Methods for the next four weeks

1.  Filter reads based on quality using DADA2
2.  Merge forward and reverse reads
3.  Run BLASTn against the NCBI nt database as a reference
4.  Calculate diversity index for each sample
5.  Make NMDS plots colored by year, month, and location
6.  Make barplots to compare relative abundances of taxa among samples
